A game company that uses some of its customers' features on a level basis creates new customer definitions (personas) and creates segments according to these new customer definitions. Creating new customers based on these segments wants to estimate how much the company can earn on average for these segments.


For an Example;
It is desired to determine how much a 25-year-old male user from Turkey, who is an IOS user, can earn on average.
